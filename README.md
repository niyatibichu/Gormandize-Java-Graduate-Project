# Gormandize-Java-Graduate-Project
Used the previous Gormandize project. Refactored the code to use JAX-RS in the back-end
Built an application using AngulaJS, MongoDB, and Node.js that helps users add reviews about a restaurant and gives a star rating to the restaurant. Refactored the same code to use JAX-RS for back-end.
